# Implementations of basic algorithms

These programs are implementations of basic algorithms, written by me during my introductory Algorithms course at IIT Bhubaneswar. 

All programs are in C. The names of the files are self explanatory. 

Hopefully, this can help other beginners in their learning.

Cheers.
